A tool to convert Markdown files to html applying CSS styles.

## Usage
- ./md_resume_conv.py `file.md`
- ./md_resume_conv.py `file.md && firefox file.html`

## Convert HTML to PDF using Chrome/FireFox
- I suggest to use FireFox to make PDF (CTRL+P)
- Use chrome to make PDF out of our html file (CTRL+P)
- You can also use `chrome --headless` to make html to pdf from cli
