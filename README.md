A tool to convert Markdown files to html applying CSS styles. Read more here https://b3nsh4.com/blog/make-pdf-from-markdown-with-css-styles/

## Usage
- ./md_resume_conv.py `file.md`
- ./md_resume_conv.py `file.md && firefox file.html`

## Convert HTML to PDF using Chrome/FireFox
- I suggest to use FireFox to make PDF (CTRL+P)
- Use chrome to make PDF out of our html file (CTRL+P)
- You can also use `chrome --headless` to make html to pdf from cli

## Footer
You can use `<i>` tag to add any footer/page numbers at the bottom of the page.
